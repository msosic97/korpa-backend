Client Applications: The client applications serve as the front-end interfaces for users. 
                     These include a web application for desktop browsers and mobile applications for iOS and Android devices. 
                     Users can browse restaurants, view menus, place orders, and track their deliveries through these applications.


API Gateway: The API gateway acts as a single entry point for client applications to interact with the backend services. 
             It handles authentication, request routing, rate limiting, and can also perform tasks like request transformation or caching. 
             It provides a unified interface for the client applications to access various backend services.



User Service: The user service manages user-related functionalities, such as user registration, authentication, and profile management. 
              It stores user information, handles password encryption, and generates authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) for secure API communication.



Restaurant Service: The restaurant service handles operations related to restaurants and menus. 
                    It allows restaurant owners or administrators to manage their restaurant information, update menus, and handle incoming orders. 
                    It may also provide functionalities like menu search, filtering, and rating/review management.



Order Service: The order service handles the entire order process. It manages order creation, updates, and cancellation. 
               It communicates with the restaurant service to place orders and dispatches delivery requests to the delivery service. 
               It also handles payment processing and integration with payment gateways.



Delivery Service: The delivery service manages the delivery process. 
                  It assigns delivery personnel to orders, tracks their locations, and updates the order status in real-time. 
                  It may include features like route optimization, estimated delivery time calculation, and notifications 
                  to customers regarding the delivery status.



Notification Service: The notification service handles the communication between the application and the users. 
                      It sends notifications to users regarding order confirmations, status updates, and delivery tracking. 
                      It can use various communication channels such as email, SMS, or push notifications.



Payment Service: The payment service handles payment processing and integration with third-party payment gateways. 
                 It securely manages customer payment information, validates payments, and communicates with the order service 
                 to confirm successful transactions.


Database and Storage: Data storage is an integral part of the application. 
                      You can use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL to store structured data such as 
                      user profiles, restaurants, menus, orders, and delivery information. 
                      For database platform will be used MySQL


External Services: The architecture may also integrate with external services, such as geolocation services for determining 
                    user locations or map services for route optimization and tracking.
